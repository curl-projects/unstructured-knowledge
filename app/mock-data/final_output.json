it'd would be useful to for instance, having the possibility for the text size to 'follow' the card size. just like images, the text could increase itsefl when we increase the card.\nnot to be applied for every text of course. just some.\nor another example: having the possibility to change the font of some text. or even color?\nthe main idea is that: we are plotting cards over a 2d physical space (whiteboard), so that our visual processing mental area could be \"better stimulated\".\ninstead of having a boring 'text wall' (even if it can be outlined as in obsidian or logseq), the whiteboard should give better mind stimulation.\nso having another dimension for changes, like being able to differentiate the text inside cards should increase the stimulation.\nbecause now, when we write a lot of cards inside a whiteboard, we can only play with the card color and card size, but many cards will still look quite similar if we don't need to change color that much. for instance because the info collected are similar in category.\nhaving bigger texts will also allow for faster reading on scaled out wb.","created_at":"2022-08-19

going to work?\nalso, on another note, do you have plans to implement ways to allow users to use a \"more diverse range of text formatting\"?\nexamples\nsometimes, you'd like to use just a brief title for a card perhaps linked with some other cards around it or not.\nbut this card with the brief title, you somehow want it to stand out a bit more with respect of other cards nearby.\nin that case it'd would be useful to for instance, having the possibility for the text size to 'follow' the card size. just like images, the text could increase itsefl when we increase the card.\nnot to be applied for every text of course. just some.\nor another example: having the possibility to change the font of some text. or even color?\nthe main idea is that: we are plotting cards over a 2d physical space (whiteboard), so that our visual processing mental area could be \"better stimulated\".\ninstead of having a boring 'text wall' (even if it can be outlined as in obsidian or logseq), the whiteboard should give better mind stimulation.\nso having another dimension for changes, like being able to differentiate the text inside cards should increase the stimulation.\nbecause now, when we write a lot of cards inside a whiteboard, we can only play with the card color and card size, but many cards will still look quite similar if we don't need to change color that much. for instance because the info collected are similar in category.\nhaving bigger texts will also allow for faster reading on scaled out wb.","created_at":"2022-08-19

the same subject is on the right...\n...and both dealing with many of the same cards\nsome other uses\n-alternatives\/proposals: like a side by side columm or row of how to order something, with alternatives side by side\nsay if it were book chapters each 'alternative' would draw the same chapter\/content cards but each in a different order\n-folded vs unfolded\nim getting used to listing a bunch of cards in folded state in one are of the board, while in another area the same cards are unfolded with relational arrows draw\n-media\na reference image being next to what it would be useful, that same reference as a card avoids pasting the same image on a bunch of cards.\ni also like the idea of using images as a sort of landmark to browse a larger map- the same card with a big warning image would be easy to spot in the 3 areas it was put, next to something theyre warning about\ni also often do duplicates temporarily- few of my boards are 'static', most are more like sketches. even when i want to map something in 1 singular way i may do more then one arrangement before deciding wich is best and then deleting the copies","created_at":"2022-02-04
